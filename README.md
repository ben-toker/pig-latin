Description: pig.c reads in a line dynamically from stdin and parses words from that line and does the pig latin transformations (using a function called piglatin which takes in a char*) on those words.

pig.c : file that transforms any string into pig latin equivalent.

Makefile : compiles pig w/ clean command for executables.

I implemented translation for "pog latin" - a language that is essentially english but with the word "pog" after every word. Running ./pig -pog enters poglatin mode.
